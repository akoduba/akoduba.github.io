                <p>Over the course of my physical computing module, I have been quite fascinated with how codes work alongside objects in the real world. It's been quite a journey but i'm glad to have learnd all that i did in the module. Here a few prototypes i made with the arduino uno kit.

                       <br>
                       <h4>Overview</h4>
                       <p style="text-align: justify">The Covid-19 doorbell prototype was created for individuals who seek to remain home without socializing due to the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus. people find it quite difficult to tell their friends or family about the risks of the corona virus and they would rather take the risk of letting in people who come to their houses unannounced without knowing if they have been keeping safe than telling them to go back home.</p> 
                       <br>
<h4>Concept</h4><p style="text-align: justify">The door bell would be of great relevance to individuals who face this issue. The White Liar is a prototype of a doorbell that detects people with high fever when they touch it. This bell responds by telling the person with high fever "Oh my goodness! Sorry hot stuff, I’m not home. Remember to stay safe".  This doorbell has the ability to lie for you, possibly make the unwanted visitor smile for calling the person “hot stuff” and say you’re not home even if you are home doing nothing but sipping a cup of coffee. Having this bell means you could lie without hurting anyone’s feelings while keeping yourself safe from potential risk. </p><br>
                           
                        
                   </div>
                   
                    
                    <div class="portfolio__item">
                    <img src="images/arduino uno - door-bell-parts.jpg" alt="Portfolio Item" class="portfolio__image">
                        <p style="text-align: justify"> However, if this doorbell detects that the person outside has no fever, it tells the visitor that the homeowner is available to see them  and that they would be with the person in a minute. This helps the user eliminate the awkward conversations of telling someone not to enter their house or telling them they're not home even if they are.

                        <h4>Limitations</h4>
                       <p style="text-align: justify">
                           Using a MAX30205 Human Body Temperature Sensor or a Long Distance Infrared Thermometer for this prototype would have been ideal for a more accurate temperature reading because often times, when the room temperature fluctuates, the TMP36 temperature sensor picks up the high or low temperature values of the room and the device starts to work without human touch and also, it takes some seconds for the sensor to go back to its regular room temperature value so while still hot, it rings some more until it cools down. This is not ideal for a doorbell. Due to the unavailability of the MAX30205 Human Body Temperature Sensor or a Long Distance Infrared Thermometer, the MP36 temperature sensor was an alright choice as proof of concept for this first prototyping stage.</p>
