      <p> I am Akoduba Ayoola Princewill, fondly called Ayoola. I am a Nigerian, a Kalabari Princess, currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Interaction and Experience Design at the <a href = "https://www.ul.ie"> University of Limerick.</a> I am also a UL Student Ambassador.  </p>

      <p>I graduated from the Department of Fine arts and Design (Graphic Arts major) at University of Port Harcourt, Rivers State. After school, I worked for four years as a creative designer/ Wordpress web designer at <a href = "https://www.cregital.com"> Cregital</a>, a creative agency in Lagos, Nigeria. Working at <a href = "https://www.cregital.com"> Cregital</a> gave me the opportunity to explore aspects of CMS platforms like Umbraco and Wordpress for web design. Here are links to three of many -   
<a href = "https://transcorpnigeria.com/"> Transcorp Nigeria,</a>  
<a href = "https://greystone.ng/"> Greystone,</a>  
<a href = "https://www.transcorphotels.com/"> Transcorp Hotels.</a> </p> 
             
      <p>I enjoy a great deal of things which are, but definitely not limited to; traveling, seeing new places, experiencing other cultures, meeting new people, making meaningful connections, hanging out with friends, long walks by the beach, fruit tea infusions, <a href = "#">movie nights</a>, helping others as much as I can, etc.</p>
