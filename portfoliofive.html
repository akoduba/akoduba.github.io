         <p>This was taken at Basel. It was the first time i learnt about the rule of thirds and cropping. However, taking this phtot with the rule of thirds in mind would have been a lot better than cropping during editing.

         <p>This was taken at Schiffl채nde, Basel. This was taken after my lessons with Sabrina St채ubli about stutter speed. This is a beautiful photo but i feel like the balance could have been a lot better.  </p>

         <p>This was taken after my lessons with Sabrina St채ubli about stutter speed. I reduced the shutterspeed for this image, focused the camera on the street light and when i was abot to click for the shot, I shook the camera up and down and this was the result. I love it! I still dont know if this is the right way to have done this but it works!  </p>

         <p>I am currently redesigning and rebuilding the ULPSU website and this was part of the four initial UI designs I did for them to chose from. This is my way of volunteering and helping out as a student ambassador.  </p>

         <p>This was an assignment in my final year at the University of Port Harcourt. The goal was to creat a curency for ECOWAS. A general currency that could be used by all countries in West Africa. I like this because it was a huge challenge and i had to improvise in somany ways.  </p>
