                       <h4>Overview</h4>
                       <p style="text-align: justify">This was a group project aimed at designing a self service station application for customers at beauty stors. This application seeks to help users with knowledge of their skin types and make shoping and finding the right products for their skin less hectic.</p> 
                      
                       <br>
                        <h4>Contributions</h4>
                       <p>My contribution to the team was drawing out the story board, wireframes and designing the low fidelity software on paper, building a ux flow chat and designing the computerised version of the self service app using an application called Sketch. I like the simplicity of the designes and the choice of colours match its purpose.  </p>

                   <div class="portfolio__item">
                    <img src="images/low%20fidelity%20prototype%20.gif" alt="Portfolio Item" class="portfolio__image">
                      <p> However, There are so many ways in which the design could have been more user friendly. For example, telling users to inpute their information in a software without giving terms aand conditions telling them what their data is being used for isnt best practice. Also, there could have been a screen after the questionnair which shows a loading animation while they are waiting to view their skin analysis.</p>

                        <h4>Learning Outcomes</h4>
                       <p style="text-align: justify">
                           Being a part of this project helped me explore new areas of user experience design like paticipatory design. Most importantly, I learnd that as a user experience designer, your thoughts about anything you're building goes beyond just the product. You also have to visualise scenearios of how you're product will be used and what could possibly lead a user to your product and how they respond to it after using it.
